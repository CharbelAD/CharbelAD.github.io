My name is Charbel Abi Daher,
I am currently a computer and telecommunications engineering student at the [Lebanese University - Faculty of Engineering](http://www.ulfg.ul.edu.lb/). 

I care about various aspects of theoretical and applied computer science, a big part of what I know is self-taught. I subscribe to the open source philosophy and mindset and believe in free access to information.

Community building and teaching are also part of my passions which is why I often find myself teaching programming (most of the time in the Python programming language) either through volunteering or in the unversity club which I co-founded with my good friend [Jad Issa](jad-issa.com).

My personal hobbies and interests include fishing, kayaking, cycling and various outside sports, chess, and solving Rubik's cube variations.

Welcome to my website :)
