I'm an engineer with Masters degree from [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version) and the [Lebanese Univerity](http://www.ulfg.ul.edu.lb/). Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at [announcing soon].

During my studies, I gained a lot of interest in algorithms and data structures, as well as model checking, game theory, and electronics. The majority of my professional experience thus far involves backend web development and Machine Learning from the design stage all the way to depoyment, I would like to explore large-scale applications in the future.

I like to participate in all kinds of programming contests (such as Google [Google Hashcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_Code_(programming_competition))), attend events, and simply be part of communities centered around my interests. I have had the chance to create such communities by co-founding RASS, a student society within the Leanese University, and creating social media groups centered around certain topics (like groups for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) together) that have endured for many years.

In my free time, I like to climb (some top-roping but mostly indoor bouldering, working on my skills to eventually try outdoor bouldering), go on bike trips, and solve miscelanous puzzles. I also love specialty coffee and cooking.
